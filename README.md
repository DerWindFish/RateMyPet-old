Are you familar with the staggeringly popular Twitter account WeRateDogs? Well now with that as the inspiration, welcome to RateMyPet! The amazing new application where users can post pictures of their own pets along side a rating, and rate the pets of the other users!

In this project I plan to use Django and PostgreSQL for my back end and React for my front end. Users will be able to sign up for accounts, view all the rated pets, submit their own ratings, and submits their own pets for rating.
